# Level 0

All we need to do here is ssh into the game. The host is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, the target port is 2220, and the username and password are both bandit0. 

So our ssh command, with the credentials and port specified, looks something like this: ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
